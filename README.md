## Introducing PixelGAN, your AI-pixel map builder. üó∫Ô∏è

### Problem Statement

The problem that PixelGAN seeks to solve is the difficulty in quickly and affordably creating detailed, personalized maps from raw images or visual data. Many current solutions require complex tools, advanced technical knowledge, or time-consuming manual processes, or limit access to high-quality pixelated maps for individuals and small organizations. This challenge impacts content creators, game developers, digital artists, and researchers by increasing production time and costs associated with map generation.

### Script Purpose
The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate how PixelGAN uses artificial intelligence to efficiently and automatically train with pixelated maps and gives a new one map for the user. It serves as a practical tool for analyzing visual data, applying adversarial generative techniques (GANs), and producing stylized maps that can be used in a variety of applications, such as graphic design or simulations. This paper provides a reproducible workflow, allowing users to easily experiment with the model, adjust parameters, and generate their own maps.

### Goal of the Idea
The idea behind PixelGAN is to democratize the creation of pixelated maps, making the process more intuitive and accessible through artificial intelligence. Inspired by the need to unite creativity and technology, the project aims to empower users ‚Äì from independent artists to development teams ‚Äì to explore new ways of visualizing spatial data. The goal is to offer a solution that combines technical isolation with artistic freedom, opening doors to innovation in areas such as games, digital art and experimental mapping.

### Output Labs
The Output Labs section presents practical examples of the results generated by PixelGAN.

### Samples (coming soon)

Example 1: Pixelated Terrain Map - A satellite image converted into a stylized map with highlighted reliefs.
Example 2: Concept Art - A photograph transformed into a pixelated map with retro aesthetics for use in 2D games.
Example 3: Advanced Customization - Demonstration of how to adjust colors, resolution and details in the generated map.
Each example includes the codes used, the settings applied, and the output files (images or other formats), allowing you to replicate or modify the experiments as needed.

#### PixelGAN is the first project at my Labs idea. Give it a try!
